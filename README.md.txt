For this website I will be making a list of recipes that include a cookie recipe, a brownie recipe, an oatmeal recipe, and a
takis chicken recipe. Through this basic HTML project I'll demonstrate how to fit pictures to a webpage and list certain instructions
to make them as well as their ingredients.
